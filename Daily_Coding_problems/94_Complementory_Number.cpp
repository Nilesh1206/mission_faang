/*
Given a positive number, return its complementary number.
Note: The complement of a number is the number that results from flipping every bit in the 
original number. (i.e. zero bits become one bits and one bits become zero bits).

Ex: Given the following numberâ€¦

number = 27, return 4.
27 in binary (not zero extended) is 11011.
Therefore, the complementary binary is 00100 which is 4.
